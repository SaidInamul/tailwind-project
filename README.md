Learning Tailwind CSS framwork for styling the website design. Here, I accomplished some Tailwind predefined class like:
1. Colors Pallete
2. Typography
3. Layout (Grid, Flex)
4. Margin and Padding
5. Media Query
6. Effect (hover)

During the learning, I checked out few UI templates on the Internet which are integrating Tailwind CSS such as:
1. Preline UI
2. Meraki UI
3. Flowbite
4. Wicked

Theses template are helpful as an inspiration to make styling website and speed up front-end development. I have used one of it as the buttons for this tutorial.
