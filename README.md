Obtaining knowledge of the Tailwind CSS framework for designing websites styles.  I learned a few Tailwind preset classes here, such as:
1. Colors Pallete
2. Typography
3. Layout (Grid, Flex)
4. Margin and Padding
5. Media Query
6. Effect (hover)

I looked at a few UI templates that incorporate Tailwind CSS while I was learning, such these:
1. Preline UI
2. Meraki UI
3. Flowbite
4. Wicked

These templates can be applied as a source of inspiration for helping expedite front-end development and decorate websites. I have used one of it as the buttons for this tutorial.
